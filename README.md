## 📌 Playwright Automation Testing Project

This repository contains an **ongoing web automation testing project** built using **Playwright**.
The project is developed incrementally to demonstrate a **structured, realistic automation workflow**, starting from core fundamentals before scaling to more advanced patterns.

At the current stage, the automation focuses on the **Login feature**, implemented using **plain Playwright syntax** to ensure clarity and strong foundational understanding.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project is created to:

* Demonstrate hands-on experience with **Playwright for Web UI automation**
* Show a **progressive automation approach**, starting simple and evolving over time
* Emphasize **readable, maintainable test scripts**
* Serve as a **QA Automation portfolio project** aligned with real-world practices

The project will be **updated regularly** as new features, improvements, and design patterns are introduced.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* **Playwright**
* **TypeScript**
* **Node.js**
* **Git & GitHub**

---

## 🧪 Current Testing Scope

### Implemented Feature

* **Login functionality**
* **Homepage UI validation**

### Covered Scenarios

* Valid login flow
* Basic validation using assertions
* Sorting Assertion

At this stage:

* Tests are written using **standard Playwright syntax**
* **Data-Driven Testing (DDT)** is **not yet applied**
* **Page Object Model (POM)** will be updated continuously

This deliberate approach ensures the fundamentals are solid before introducing abstractions.

---

## 🧭 Automation Approach

* Tests are written with **clear, explicit steps**
* Assertions focus on **functional correctness**
* Emphasis on **test readability and intent**
* Structure is prepared to support future scalability (POM, DDT, CI integration)

This reflects a real-world automation journey, where stability and clarity come before optimization.
